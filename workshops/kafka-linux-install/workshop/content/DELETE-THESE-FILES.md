# Files to Delete

Please delete the following duplicate files manually:

```bash
cd /home/bocinec/repo/educates-labs/workshops/kafka-linux-install/workshop/content
rm 01-kafka-installation.md
rm 02-single-broker.md
rm 03-topic-operations.md
rm 04-cluster-setup.md
rm 05-cluster-operations.md
```

- 01-container-setup.md
- 02-kafka-installation.md
- 03-single-broker.md
- 04-topic-operations.md
- 05-cluster-setup.md
- 06-cluster-operations.md
