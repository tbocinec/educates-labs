## Why Docker?

Running Grafana in Docker offers several advantages:
- **Quick setup** - No manual installation required
- **Isolation** - Runs in its own container
- **Portability** - Same image works everywhere
- **Easy updates** - Just pull a new image
- **Consistency** - Identical environments across dev/test/prod

## Prerequisites
Basic Docker knowledge helpful but not required. We'll explain each step!

---
## Command Usage Pattern
