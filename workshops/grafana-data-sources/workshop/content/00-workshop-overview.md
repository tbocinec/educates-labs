# Grafana Data Sources Workshop

Welcome to the Grafana Data Sources Workshop. In this lab you will:

1. Set up Grafana with Prometheus using Docker Compose
2. Configure Prometheus as a data source and visualize metrics
3. Set up Grafana with InfluxDB and create time-series visualizations
4. Set up Grafana with ClickHouse and query data
5. Compare different data source types and use cases

> Tip: All shell command blocks are clickable – when you click, the command will be executed in the terminal pane.
