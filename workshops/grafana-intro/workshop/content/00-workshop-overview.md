# Grafana Intro Workshop

Welcome to the Grafana Intro Workshop. In this lab you will:

1. Install Grafana locally in the Linux environment provided by Educates.
2. Start the Grafana server process.
3. Access Grafana through the embedded portal tab.
4. Add a (mock) Prometheus data source.
5. Build a simple dashboard and panel.

> Tip: All shell command blocks are clickable – when you click, the command will be copied/executed in the terminal pane.

## Prerequisites
The workshop environment already gives you a Linux shell. No prior Grafana knowledge required.

---
## Command Usage Pattern
Code blocks use `bash`. Click a line or copy it manually. Multi-line commands should be executed together.
