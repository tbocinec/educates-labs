# Kafka with Java Applications

Java-based workshop demonstrating Apache Kafka with producer and consumer applications. Build and run real Java code that sends and receives messages through Kafka.

## Workshop Features

- ☕ **Java JDK 21** - Pre-configured development environment
- 🔨 **Maven Projects** - Ready-to-build producer and consumer applications  
- 🐳 **Docker Compose** - Kafka with KRaft mode (no Zookeeper needed)
- 📊 **Kafka UI** - Visual monitoring and message exploration
- 🚀 **Automatic Setup** - Services start automatically when workshop begins

## What You'll Build

### 📝 **Producer Application**
- Sends 50 numbered messages with timestamps
- Uses proper Kafka producer configuration
- Demonstrates partitioning and key-based distribution
- Shows async sending with callbacks

### 📖 **Consumer Application**  
- Reads messages from test topic
- Uses consumer groups for scalability
- Displays message details with partition/offset info
- Handles continuous polling pattern

## Workshop Steps

1. **Environment Setup** - Verify Kafka startup and topic creation
2. **Topic Management** - Explore topics and partitioning
3. **Build Applications** - Compile Java producer and consumer
4. **Run Producer** - Send messages to Kafka topic
5. **Run Consumer** - Read and display messages
6. **Kafka UI Exploration** - Visual analysis and monitoring
7. **Summary** - Key concepts and next steps

## Technical Stack

- **Apache Kafka 7.7.1** with KRaft mode
- **Java 21** with Maven build system
- **Kafka UI 0.7.2** for visual management
- **Docker Compose** for service orchestration

## Prerequisites

No prior Kafka experience required. Basic Java knowledge helpful but not essential - all code is provided.

## Duration

Approximately 90 minutes including hands-on exercises and exploration.
